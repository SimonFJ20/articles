**Why having no ideology is unproductive and decievingly ideological.**

## What is an ideology?

Formal definition:
The field of ideology is defined as "the science of ideas". The concept of an ideology, is a set, collection, or group of ideas, concepts, beliefs, principles, philosophies, assertions, theories, aims, ways of thinking, frameworks of thought, etc. often shared by a group of people. Ideologies often revolve around polical, economical, cultural, and systems in a large understanding, and often used to constitue a sociopolitical program. Ideologies are often, but not necessarily, developed by a group of people subscribing to the ideology itself.[1][2]

An ideology is often thought of as a collection of shared ideas, that a person can believe/not believe, subscribe/not subscribe to, agree/not agree with, and so on.
Ideologies are often derived from other ideologies, not necessarily inheriting the everything, but using the other ideologies as foundation. Ideologies are most often developed by individuals or specific groups, and many times the ideology is developed further by other groups and individuals, sometimes in a dialogal sense, often with developing branches to new ideologies.

Since ideologies are just ideas, they aren't right/wrong, correct/incorrect in absolute terms, although they can be coherrent/contradictory. With the defintion "coherrent system of ideas" ideologies with contradictions could be categorized as 'false' ideologies. For example, if T as a set of ideas is an ideology, A is the idea that X is Y, B is the idea that X is not Y, and T contains A and B, then T is a contradictory ideology in absolute terms, meaning T will be inherently contradictory in any context, because X can never be both Y and not Y, therefore the it could be considered a false ideology.

Ideologies can though be considered right/wrong, correct/incorrect, etc. when put into a context, such as in analysis or comparison in light of another ideology, or application in the real world. With context, an ideology can be further evaluted for contradictions. For example, if T is an ideology, A is the idea that X is Y, B is the idea that X is Z, T contains A and B, R is an ideology, C is the idea that Y is not Z, R contains C, then T is a contradictory ideology in the context of C, since X cannot be both Y and Z, since Y is not C. We can then use some context, which will tell us, whether some ideas are right/wrong, correct/incorrect, to examine those characteristics of a given ideology. For example, an ideology containing the idea, that water isn't a liquid, is incorrect in the context of our material reality, where water is a liquid. Another example could be an ideology, inwhich killing people is morally correct, this ideology examined in the context of an ideology, inwhich killing people is morally incorrect, such as christianity with the "Thau shalt not kill" commandment, the ideology can only be concluded as incorrect. Because the determination of right/wrong and correct/incorrect require context, they are subjective characteristics. While contradiction is an objective measure of an ideology. What is evident from this explanation, is that subjective judgemental characteristics are based on contradictions of ideology. Enough philosohpy.

Many major ideologies are given names, and documented. An example of a relatively major named ideology could very well be the ideology of homosexuality. The idea that some human beings are capable of experiencing sexual attraction towards other humans of the same gender. This is an ideology based on the ideologies of psychology and biology, which themselves are ideologies based on modern science and practical medicine.

TL;DR: Ideologies are a collection of shared ideas. Some of them have names.

## How can we use ideologies?

One purpose ideologies serve well, is as means of communicating ideas to others. A shared understanding of a certain ideology, can serve to aid in discussing the topics relating to the ideology. Having a shared foundation or framework to built discourse on, is comparatively a lot more efficient, than having to built up a sufficient understanding of the others ideas, by means of explaining atomic ideas.

An example of a discussion or conversation aided by ideology could be, me asking my friend, how many sheep there are on the field. When my friend then answers five, we have now use the ideology of mathematics to aid our conversation. Although implicit in it's involvement, this conversation would have been severely inefficient and arduous, compared to us both having a common understanding of the ideology of mathematics, allowing us to understand count, counting, numbers, and so on. What is evident from this example, is that each and every concept, can be thought of as an ideology. Another point is that we didn't necessarily have to use the common ideology of mathematics itself. We might have used a completely different set of ideas amounting to the same in this specific scenario. Although this may be true, by analysing the scenario with the context of mathmematics, we can understand it in terms of the common understanding of mathematics.

As just shown, another purpose for ideology is as means for aiding in analysis of subject matters. One can use ideologies as tools for analysing and understanding different more or less related topics. In this sense, the ideologies could be considered tools with the purpose of adding context to the analysis. And as explained before, when given a context, we can begin subjective analysis of the ideology in the context, and by extension, understand objective contradiction of an ideology in the context.
